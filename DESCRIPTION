Description: SangerAlignment is a simple package which allows you to import
    .ab1 sequencing files and convert them into DNA strings. gRNA text
    sequences can also be imported and converted into strings. gRNA strings
    and DNA strings can then be aligned and the output visualised in a 
    browser. SangerAlignment is useful for identifying the effects of gRNA 
    incorporation (e.g. via CRISPR) on the wild-type genome.
